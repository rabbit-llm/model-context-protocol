# Exercise 1: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Architecture Deep Dive

This exercise explores the architecture of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), as described in [this Substack post](https://rabbitllm.substack.com/p/mcp-part-2-architecture-deep-dive).

## Overview

MCP is a protocol designed to standardize how context is managed and exchanged between language models and external systems. The architecture focuses on modularity, extensibility, and interoperability, enabling seamless integration of various context providers and consumers.

## Key Concepts

- **Context Providers**: Components that supply relevant context to the model (e.g., databases, APIs).
- **Context Consumers**: Entities (like LLMs) that use the provided context to enhance responses.
- **Protocol Messages**: Standardized messages for context exchange, ensuring compatibility across systems.

## Goals

- Understand the core components of MCP.
- Learn how context flows through the system.
- Experiment with modular integration of context sources.
